## Important notes:

I wasn't able to install packages within the .Rmd file. The problem seems to be about the local repository: it connot be universally set for all users in the world. It would also not make sense to install packages every time you knit a document...
To be able knit the .Rmd correctly, you will need to install the following packages: ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, simputation.
Thanks, and sorry for the inconvenience.
